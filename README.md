# Hi, I’m Rudra Shah 👋  
**Software Engineer | AI / ML | Backend & Systems Builder**

I like building things that actually work in the real world.  
Not demos. Not toy projects. Real systems that handle data, users, and constraints.

I sit at the intersection of **software engineering, machine learning, and product thinking**.  
My focus is simple: build reliable systems, understand the data behind them, and make decisions that scale.
