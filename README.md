# Hi, I’m Rudra Shah 👋  
**Software Engineer | AI / ML | Backend & Systems Builder**

I like building things that actually work in the real world.  
Not demos. Not toy projects. Real systems that handle data, users, and constraints.

I sit at the intersection of **software engineering, machine learning, and product thinking**.  
My focus is simple: build reliable systems, understand the data behind them, and make decisions that scale.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Do
- Design and build **backend systems & APIs** that don’t fall apart under load  
- Work hands-on with **ML models** (training, fine-tuning, inference, optimization)  
- Turn vague ideas into **shippable products**  
- Care deeply about **performance, correctness, and clarity**

I enjoy problems where the answer isn’t obvious and trade-offs matter.

## ⚙️ Tech I’m Comfortable With
**Languages**
- Python, Java, Swift  

**Backend & Infra**
- REST APIs, Authentication systems  
- AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, Cloud deployments)  
- Server-side performance tuning  

**AI / ML**
- Model training & evaluation  
- ML pipelines  
- Applied AI for real products (not just notebooks)

**Other**
- Git, Linux, System debugging  
- Product-oriented engineering mindset

## 🧩 How I Think About Engineering
- Simple > clever  
- Working systems > theoretical perfection  
- Clear trade-offs > vague optimism  

I’d rather ship something solid and improve it than chase abstract “best practices” without context.
